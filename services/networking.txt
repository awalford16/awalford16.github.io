I have helped manage Datacenter networks for AI workloads for over 3 years, working mostly with Dell and Cisco.

I can provide support with:

- Identifying single points of failure or bottlenecks
- Fault finding
- Improving network security
- Automating network changes/deployments with Terraform or Ansible
- Network migrations
- Hybrid cloud setup with IPSec VPN tunnels
