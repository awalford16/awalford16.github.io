##What is it?

Openstack is an opensource tool designed to be deployed on top of on-premise/physical hardware to provide a cloud-like management of the hardware.

It uses opensource tooling like KVM to provision and manage Virtual Machines on the hosts.


## Deployment

Openstack can be deployed in a number of ways. A popular tool for deployment is Kayobe which deploys the Openstack services to machines as docker containers.

Kayobe uses kolla-ansible to automate the deployment of these services.
