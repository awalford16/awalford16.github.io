# Projects

This is a brief overview of the projects on my GitHub page.

## AnonyQs (NodeJS)

[Repo](https://github.com/awalford16/AnonyQs)

This was something I put together during my internship. It was designed to help newbies feel more confident in asking questions they think may be stupid.


## Charts (Helm)

[Repo](https://github.com/awalford16/charts)

This is some more recent work for Helm charts that I put together for day-to-day projects. These will mostly just be experimental helm charts for testing out different deployment concepts but also works as my own hosted chart repository.


## Electrical

[Repo](https://github.com/awalford16/electrical)

I am currently working on more electrical-based stuff and want to learn a bit more embedded systems programming. I started this repo to test my C programming by implementing some electrical calculations


## Home

[Repo](https://github.com/awalford16/home)

This is my home automation repository. It defines all the services that I run on a raspberry pi at home and also where I would deploy any local dev stuff I may like to host. It leverages the charts in the Charts repo and FluxCD to easily deploy all my home services via GitOps.


## Root (React Native)

[Repo](https://github.com/awalford16/Root)

This was a university project for building a cross-platform app. It is designed to encourage sustainable travel choices by rewarding uses for tracking bike and walking journeys over taking the car.
